What we already know: 

-Deforestation can be defined as the clearing or thinning of forests by humans. 
-Deforestation represents one of the largest issues in global land use.

-We have looked at the impact of certain species/animals in our other datasets. Now we are looking specifically at the facts for the world's population. 
-Fire which is "MAN-made" is also commonly used to clear forests in Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, and the Americas for permanent oil palm plantations.

-When forests are burned, their carbon is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,
a greenhouse gas that has the potential to alter global climate (see greenhouse effect;
global warming), and the trees are no longer present to sequester more carbon.

WORKING TO REDUCE DEFORESTATION

-Eliminating all deforestation is not possible. 
Parts of the landscape will need to be reshaped and altered as populations grow and changeâ€”but this can be balanced through sustainable forest management, 
reforestation efforts and maintaining the integrity of protected areas.

-Given the amount of deforestation around the world, zero net deforestation may seem unattainable. 
However, it is not only possible, but necessary if we intend to preserve our most precious wildlife, 
respect and empower local communities, maintain critical ecosystem services and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
